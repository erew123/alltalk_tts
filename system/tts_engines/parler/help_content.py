    - **Low VRAM Mode**
        - Optimizes memory usage for systems with limited GPU memory
        - Efficiently manages resources by moving data between CPU and GPU
        - Recommended for systems with less than 4GB VRAM or when running alongside other GPU-intensive applications

    - **DeepSpeed Capability**
        - Accelerates TTS generation using optimized inference
        - Only available for engines and models that support DeepSpeed
        - Requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
        
    - **Stream Response Capability**
        - Enables real-time streaming of generated speech output
        - Reduces latency for faster feedback during synthesis

    - **Temperature Control**
        - Adjusts the variability in speech generation
        - **Range**: 0.0 to 1.0
        - **Lower values** (0.1-0.5): More consistent, stable output
        - **Higher values** (0.6-1.0): More variable, potentially more natural-sounding output

    - **Repetition Penalty**
        - Helps prevent repetitive speech patterns
        - **Range**: 1.0 to 15.0
        - Higher values more strongly discourage repetition
        - Typically most effective between 1.0-3.0

    - **Pitch Adjustment**
        - Modifies the voice pitch when supported
        - **Range**: -20 to +20
        - Use subtle adjustments for most natural results

    - **Generation Speed**
        - Controls the pace of generated speech
        - **Range**: 0.5 to 2.0

    ## üó£Ô∏è Voice Configuration

    ### OpenAI Voice Mappings
    - Only relevant when using the OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
    - Maps OpenAI's six standard voices to equivalent voices in the current engine:
        - `alloy`
        - `echo`
        - `fable`
        - `nova`
        - `onyx`
        - `shimmer`
    - Essential for maintaining compatibility with OpenAI API calls
    - Each mapping can be customized to any available voice in the current engine

    Information on the OpenAI Endpoint is available in the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/wiki)

    ### Default Voices
    - **Default/Character Voice**: Used when no specific voice is specified in API calls
    - **Narrator Voice**: Separate default for narrator-specific text
    - These defaults are engine-specific and won't affect other TTS engines
    - Can be overridden by explicitly specifying voices in API calls

    ## ‚öôÔ∏è Important Notes

    - Settings availability is determined by engine capabilities
    - Grayed-out options indicate features not supported by the current engine
    - Changes only affect the currently selected TTS engine
    - Settings here act as defaults but can be overridden via API parameters
    - All changes require clicking "Update Settings" to take effect    
    - Some settings require an engine reload to take effect

    ## üéØ Parler TTS Engine Settings Help

    Parler TTS is a unique text-to-speech system that generates voices based on descriptive prompts, similar to how image generation AI works with text descriptions.
    """

    HELP_PAGE1 = """
    ## üìÅ File Locations & Management

    - **Model Storage**
        - Models are stored in `/alltalk_tts/models/parler/{model name}`

    ## üéöÔ∏è Engine Capabilities & Controls

    - **Low VRAM Mode**
        - Enabled by default for optimized memory management
        - Helps balance resource usage when running alongside other applications
        - Recommended for most setups

    - **Multi-Model Support**
        - Supports multiple internal models for voice generation
        - Allows for diverse voice characteristics and styles
        - Enables both native and custom voice descriptions

    ## üó£Ô∏è Voice System

    ### Native Voices
    - 34 built-in consistent voices including:
        - Aaron, Alisa, Anna, Barbara, Bill, etc.
        - Each native voice provides more consistent results
        - Use these when you need reproducible voice characteristics

    ### Custom Voice Descriptions
    - Create voices by describing desired characteristics:
        - Gender and age
        - Speaking style and pace
        - Accent and tone
        - Audio quality characteristics
    - **Example**: "A female speaker with an enthusiastic and lively voice. Her tone is bright and energetic, with a fast pace and a lot of inflection."

    ### Voice Editor
    - Add and manage custom voice descriptions
    - Save frequently used voice configurations
    - Edit existing voice descriptions
    - Voice settings are stored in `system/tts_engines/parler/parler_voices.json`
    """
        
    HELP_PAGE2 = """
    ## üìù Important Notes

    - **Voice Consistency**
        - Unlike traditional TTS engines, each generation may sound slightly different
        - Native voices provide more consistent results
        - Custom voice descriptions may vary between generations

    - **Audio Quality Control**
        - Include "very clear audio" in description for highest quality
        - Use "very noisy audio" for intentional background noise
        - Control reverb and recording proximity through descriptions

    - **Best Practices**
        - Use punctuation to control speech rhythm
        - Be specific in voice descriptions
        - Test different description combinations for desired results
        - Consider using native voices for consistent output

    ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

    - No support for:
        - DeepSpeed acceleration
        - Pitch adjustment
        - Generation speed control
        - Repetition penalty
        - Temperature adjustment
        - Streaming generation
        - Multi-language capabilities

    ## üîß System Requirements

    - Runs on all major operating systems:
        - Windows
        - Linux
        - macOS
    - Outputs in WAV format
    - May show flash attention warnings on Windows (normal behavior)

    VOICE_EDITOR = """
    ## üéôÔ∏è Parler Voice Editor Help

    The Voice Editor allows you to create, manage, and customize voice descriptions for Parler TTS. Each voice consists of a name and a detailed description that defines its characteristics.
    """
    
    VOICE_EDITOR1 = """
    ## üìù Creating Voice Descriptions

    ### Basic Structure
    - **Voice Name**: A unique identifier for your voice (e.g., "Soothing female", "Angry Tom")
    - **Voice Description**: Detailed description of voice characteristics

    ### Description Components
    Include these elements for best results:
    - Gender and age characteristics
    - Speaking style and pace
    - Tone and emotional quality
    - Audio environment/quality
    - Accent or language characteristics (if desired)

    ### Example Descriptions
    `A female speaker with a soft, soothing voice. Her tone is gentle and calming, with a slight reverb as if she is in a small, cozy room.`

    `A male speaker with a strong, authoritative voice. His tone is firm and commanding, with a slight bass boost that adds to the depth. He speaks at a moderate pace.`
    """

    VOICE_EDITOR2 = """
    ## üí° Best Practices

    - **Be Specific**: The more detailed your description, the better the results
    - **Include Audio Quality**: Mention desired audio characteristics (clear, reverb, etc.)
    - **Consider Pacing**: Specify speaking speed (slow, moderate, fast)
    - **Define Personality**: Include emotional and stylistic elements

    ## üîß Managing Voices

    - Use **Add/Save Voice** to create new or update existing voices
    - **Delete Selected Voice** removes the currently selected voice
    - **Clear Text Boxes** resets the input fields
    - Select any voice from the dropdown to edit its properties

    ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

    - Each generation may sound slightly different even with the same description
    - Native voices tend to be more consistent than custom voices
    - Changes are saved to the voice configuration file automatically
