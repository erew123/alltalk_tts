    - **Low VRAM Mode**
        - Optimizes memory usage for systems with limited GPU memory
        - Efficiently manages resources by moving data between CPU and GPU
        - Recommended for systems with less than 4GB VRAM or when running alongside other GPU-intensive applications

    - **DeepSpeed Capability**
        - Accelerates TTS generation using optimized inference
        - Only available for engines and models that support DeepSpeed

    ## üó£Ô∏è Voice Configuration

    ### OpenAI Voice Mappings
    - Only relevant when using the OpenAI-compatible API endpoint
    - Maps OpenAI's six standard voices to equivalent voices in the current engine:
        - `alloy`
        - `echo`
        - `fable`
        - `nova`
        - `onyx`
        - `shimmer`
    - Essential for maintaining compatibility with OpenAI API calls
    - Each mapping can be customized to any available voice in the current engine

    Information on the OpenAI Endpoint is available in the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/wiki)

    ### Default Voices
    - **Default/Character Voice**: Used when no specific voice is specified in API calls
    - **Narrator Voice**: Separate default for narrator-specific text
    - These defaults are engine-specific and won't affect other TTS engines
    - Can be overridden by explicitly specifying voices in API calls

    ## ‚öôÔ∏è Important Notes

    - Settings availability is determined by engine capabilities
    - Grayed-out options indicate features not supported by the current engine
    - Changes only affect the currently selected TTS engine
    - Settings here act as defaults but can be overridden via API parameters
    - All changes require clicking "Update Settings" to take effect    
    - Some settings require an engine reload to take effect

    ## üéØ XTTS Voice Cloning Engine Help

    XTTS is a powerful multi-speaker, voice cloning model that can generate speech in multiple languages using short audio samples for voice cloning.
    """

    HELP_PAGE1 = """
    ## üéöÔ∏è Engine Capabilities & Controls

    - **DeepSpeed Support**
        - Accelerates generation using optimized inference
        - Requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
        - 2-3x speed improvement in generation
        - Recommended when available

    - **Multi-Language Support**
        - Clone voices across multiple languages
        - No need for language-specific training
        - Full Hindi support in v2.0.3 (API Local method only)
        - Natural-sounding output in target language

    - **Generation Methods**
        - API Local: Standard generation method
        - XTTSv2 Local: Enhanced method with DeepSpeed support
        - Each method may produce slightly different results
        - Try both methods if voice quality isn't optimal

    ## üé§ Voice Sample Creation Guide

    ### Audio Requirements
    - Format: WAV or MP3
    - Sample Rate: 22050Hz
    - Channels: Mono
    - Bit Depth: 16-bit
    - Duration: 6-30 seconds (optimal: 8-10 seconds)

    ### Recording Tips
    1. **Audio Quality**
        - Choose clear, clean recordings
        - Avoid background noise, music, or echoes
        - Watch for audio artifacts like hiss or hum
        - Ensure consistent volume levels

    2. **Speech Content**
        - Use flowing, natural speech
        - Avoid long pauses or gaps
        - Include some emotional range
        - Avoid breathing sounds at start/end
        - Choose samples with good vocal variety

    ### Using Audacity
    1. **Basic Editing**
        - Open your audio file in Audacity
        - Select the best 6-30 second segment
        - Remove unwanted sounds or silence

    2. **Processing Steps**
        ```
        1. Clean up audio if needed (noise reduction, normalization)
        2. Tracks > Resample to 22050Hz
        3. Tracks > Mix > Stereo to Mono
        4. File > Export Audio as WAV
        ```

    ## üó£Ô∏è Voice Management

    ### Single Voice Setup
    - Place WAV/MP3 files in `/alltalk_tts/voices/`
    - Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `broadcaster_male.wav`)
    - Files appear as individual voices in interface
    - Best for quick testing or simple use cases

    ### Multi-Voice Sets
    - Create folders in `/alltalk_tts/voices/xtts_multi_voice_sets/`
    - Add multiple samples per voice
    - System randomly selects up to 5 samples
    - Better for consistent voice reproduction
    - Example: `/voices/xtts_multi_voice_sets/broadcaster_voice/`

    ### Pre-computed Latents
    - Stored in `/voices/xtts_latents/`
    - Faster generation times
    - Reduced memory usage
    - Recommended for frequently used voices
    """
        
    HELP_PAGE2 = """

    ## üîç Troubleshooting Voice Quality

    If voice cloning results aren't satisfactory:

    1. **Audio Quality Issues**
        - Verify sample meets technical requirements
        - Check for background noise
        - Ensure proper resampling
        - Try processing audio to improve clarity

    2. **Generation Options**
        - Try both API Local and XTTSv2 Local methods
        - Adjust temperature settings
        - Use multiple voice samples
        - Consider creating latents

    3. **Advanced Solutions**
        - Try model finetuning (see Github Wiki)
        - Use RVC pipeline for additional processing
        - Test different voice samples
        - Remember: 100% match isn't possible

        - Set to 'Disabled' to keep all files

    ## üí° Best Practices

    1. **Sample Selection**
        - Use high-quality recordings
        - Choose emotionally varied speech
        - Avoid background noise
        - Test multiple samples

    2. **Performance**
        - Enable DeepSpeed when available
        - Use pre-computed latents
        - Consider multi-voice sets
        - Monitor system resources

    3. **Workflow**
        - Process audio before use
        - Test both generation methods
        - Keep original samples organized
        - Regular cleanup of output files
