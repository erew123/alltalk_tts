#### Updates
The latest build (13 Dec 2023) has had the entire text filtering engine and narration engine rebuilt from scratch. It's highly complicated how its actually working, but the end result it a much clearer TTS output and much better control over the narrator option and how to handle text that isnt within quotes or asterisks. It does however mean you need to ensure your character card is set up correctly if using the narrator function. Details are below in the installation notes.

DeepSpeed **v11.2** can be installed within the **default text-generation-webui Python 3.11 environment**. Installs in custom Python environments are possible, but can be more complicated. Instructions [here](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts##deepspeed-installation-options) (or scroll down).

## 🟩 Installation on Text generation web UI
This has been tested on the current Dec 2023 release of Text generation webUI. If you have not updated it for a while, you may wish to update Text generation webUI, [instructions here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install)

1) In a command prompt/terminal window you need to move into your Text generation webUI folder:<br><br>
`cd text-generation-webui`

2) Start the Text generation webUI Python environment for your OS:<br><br>
`cmd_windows.bat`, `./cmd_linux.sh`, `cmd_macos.sh` or `cmd_wsl.bat`

3) Move into your extensions folder:<br><br>
`cd extensions`

4) Once there git clone this repository:<br><br>
`git clone https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts`

5) Move into the **alltalk_tts** folder:<br><br>
`cd alltalk_tts`

6) Install the requirements that are correct for your machine:<br><br>
**Nvidia graphics card machines** - `pip install -r requirements_nvidia.txt`<br><br>
**Other machines (mac, amd etc)** - `pip install -r requirements_other.txt`

7) **(Optional DeepSpeed)** If you have an Nvidia Graphics card on a system running Linux or Windows and wish to use **DeepSpeed** please follow these instructions [here](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts?#-deepspeed-installation-options). **However**, I would highly reccommend before you install DeepSpeed, you start text-generation-webui up, confirm AllTalk starts correctly and everything is working, as DeepSpeed can add another layer of complications troubleshooting any potential start-up issues. If necessary you can `pip uninstall deepspeed`.

8) You can now start move back to the main Text generation webUI folder `cd ..` (a few times), start Text generation webUI (`start_windows.bat`,`./start_linux.sh`, `start_macos.sh` or `start_wsl.bat`)  and load the AllTalk extension in the Text generation webUI **session** tab.
   
9) Please read the note below about start-up times and also the note about ensuring your character cards are set up [correctly](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts#the-one-thing-i-cant-easily-work-around)

10) Some extra voices downloadable [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bYdZdr3L69kmzUN3vSiqZmLRD7-A3M47/view?usp=drive_link)

#### 🟩 Other installation notes
On first startup, AllTalk will download the Coqui XTTSv2 2.0.2 model to its **models** folder (1.8GB space required). Check the command prompt/terminal window if you want to know what its doing. After it says "Model Loaded" the Text generation webUI is usually available on its IP address a few seconds later, for you to connect to in your browser.

Once the extension is loaded, please find all documentation and settings on the link provided in the interface (as shown in the screenshot below).

**Where to find voices** https://aiartes.com/voiceai or https://commons.wikimedia.org/ or interviews on youtube etc. Instructions on how to cut down and prepare a voice sample are within the built in documentation.

#### 🟩 The one thing I cant easily work around
Narrator function specific - With a RP chat with your AI, **on your character card** `parameters menu` > `character tab` > `greeting` make sure that anything in there that is the **narrator is in asterisks** and anything **spoken is in double quotes**, then hit the `save` (💾) button. Greeting paragraphs/sentences are handled differently from how the AI sends text and so its difficut to account for them both.

I could force a delimeter in at this stage, but I know it would/may affect things further down the line in the chat and I need a good think about that before just making a change. This issue **only** affects the greeting card/start of conversation and the "example" card that comes with text-generation-webui suffers this issue (if you want to try it for yourself). So you would put double quotes around like this (from the example card):

`"`*Hey! I'm so excited to finally meet you. I've heard so many great things about you and I'm eager to pick your brain about computers. I'm sure you have a wealth of knowledge that I can learn from.*`"`

## 🟪 Updating
This is pretty much a repeat of the installation process. 

1) In a command prompt/terminal window you need to move into your Text generation webUI folder:<br><br>
`cd text-generation-webui`

2) Move into your extensions and alltalk_tts folder:<br><br>
`cd extensions` then `cd alltalk_tts`

3) At the command prompt/terminal, type:<br><br>
`git pull`

4) Install the correct requirements for your machine:<br><br>
**Nvidia graphics card machines** - `pip install -r requirements_nvidia.txt`<br><br>
**Other machines (mac, amd etc)** - `pip install -r requirements_other.txt`

#### 🟪 Updating "git pull" error

<details>
	<summary>Click to expand</summary><br>
	
I did leave a mistake in the `/extensions/alltalk_tts/.gitignore` file at one point. If your `git pull` doesnt work, you can either follow the Problems Updating section below, or edit the `.gitignore` file and **replace its entire contents** with the below, save the file, then re-try the `git pull`<br><br>
```
voices/*.*
models/*.*
outputs/*.*
config.json
confignew.json
models.json
diagnostics.log
```
</details>

#### 🟪 Updating other problems

<details>
	<summary>Click to expand</summary><br>

If you do experience any problems, the simplest method to resolve this will be:

1) re-name the existing `alltalk_tts` folder to something like `alltalk_tts.old`

2) Start a console/terminal then:<br><br>
`cd text-generation-webui` and start your python environment `cmd_windows.bat`, `./cmd_linux.sh`, `cmd_macos.sh` or `cmd_wsl.bat`

3) Move into the extensions folder, same as if you were doing a fresh installation:<br><br>
`cd extensions` then<br><br>
`git clone https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts`

This will download a fresh installation. 

3) Move into the **alltalk_tts** folder:<br><br>
`cd alltalk_tts`

4) Install the correct requirements for your machine:<br><br>
**Nvidia graphics card machines** - `pip install -r requirements_nvidia.txt`<br><br>
**Other machines (mac, amd etc)** - `pip install -r requirements_other.txt`

5) Before starting it up, copy/merge the `models`, `voices` and `outputs` folders over from the `alltalk_tts.old` folder to the newly created `alltalk_tts` folder. This will keep your voices history and also stop it re-downloading the model again.

You can now start text-generation-webui or AllTalk (standalone) and it should start up fine. You will need to re-set any saved configuration changes on the configuration page. 

Assuming its all working fine and you are happy, you can delete the old alltalk_tts.old folder.

## 🟨 Help with problems

#### 🟨 How to make a diagnostics report file
<details>
	<summary>Click to expand</summary>
	
1) Open a command prompt window, move into your **text-generation-webui** folder, you can now start the Python environment for text-generation-webui:<br><br>
`cmd_windows.bat`, `./cmd_linux.sh`, `cmd_macos.sh` or `cmd_wsl.bat`

2) Move into the **alltalk_tts** folder:<br><br>
`cd extensions` and then `cd alltalk_tts`

3) Run the diagnostics and select the requirements file name you installed AllTalk with:<br><br>
`python diagnostics.py`

4) You will have an on screen output showing your environment setttings, file versions request vs whats installed and details of your graphics card (if Nvidia). This will also create a file called `diagnostics.log` in the `alltalk_tts` folder, that you can upload if you need to create a support ticket on here.<br><br>

![image](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/assets/35898566/81b9a6e1-c54b-4da0-b85d-3c6fde566d6a)

#### 🟨 [AllTalk Startup] Warning TTS Subprocess has NOT started up yet, Will keep trying for 120 seconds maximum. Please wait. It times out after 120 seconds.

<details>
	<summary>Click to expand</summary><br>
	When the subprocess is starting 2x things are occurring:<br><br>

**A)** Its trying to load the voice model into your graphics card VRAM (assuming you have a Nvidia Graphics card, otherwise its your system RAM)<br>
**B)** Its trying to start up the mini-webserver and send the "ready" signal back to the main process.

**Note:** If you need to create a support ticket, please create a `diagnostics.log` report file to submit with a support request. Details on doing this are above.

Before giving other possibilities, some people with **old machines** are finding their startup times are **very** slow 2-3 minutes. Ive extended the allowed time within the script from 1 minute to 2 minutes. **If you have an older machine** and wish to try extending this further, you can do so by editing `script.py` and changing line 251 `timeout = 120` changing the timeout to a larger value e.g `timeout = 240` (4 minutes).

Other possibilities for this issue are:

1) You are starting AllTalk in both your `CMD FLAG.txt` and `settings.yaml` file. The `CMD FLAG.txt` you would have manually edited and the `settings.yaml` is the one you change and save in the `session` tab of text-generation-webui and you can `Save UI defaults to settings.yaml`. Please only have one of those two starting up AllTalk.

2) You are not starting text-generation-webui with its normal Python environment. Please start it with start_{your OS version} as detailed [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui#how-to-install) (`start_windows.bat`,`./start_linux.sh`, `start_macos.sh` or `start_wsl.bat`) OR (`cmd_windows.bat`, `./cmd_linux.sh`, `cmd_macos.sh` or `cmd_wsl.bat` and then `python server.py`).
   
3) You have installed the wrong version of DeepSpeed on your system, for the wrong version of Python/Text-generation-webui. You can go to your text-generation-webui folder in a terminal/command prompt and run the correct cmd version for your OS e.g. (`cmd_windows.bat`, `./cmd_linux.sh`, `cmd_macos.sh` or `cmd_wsl.bat`) and then you can type `pip uninstall deepspeed` then try loading it again. If that works, please see here for the correct instructions for installing DeepSpeed [here](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts#-deepspeed-installation-options). 

4) You have an old version of text-generation-webui (pre Dec 2023) I have not tested on older versions of text-generation-webui, so cannot confirm viability on older versions. For instructions on updating the text-generation-webui, please look [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui#how-to-install) (`update_linux.sh`, `update_windows.bat`, `update_macos.sh`, or `update_wsl.bat`).

5) You already have something running on port 7851 on your computer, so the mini-webserver cant start on that port. You can change this port number by editing the `confignew.json` file and changing `"port_number": "7851"` to `"port_number": "7602"` or any port number you wish that isn’t reserved. Only change the number and save the file, do not change the formatting of the document. This will at least discount that you have something else clashing on the same port number.

6) You have antivirus/firewalling that is blocking that port from being accessed. If you had to do something to allow text-generation-webui through your antivirus/firewall, you will have to do that for this too.

7) You have quite old graphics drivers and may need to update them.

8) Something within text-generation-webui is not playing nicely for some reason. You can go to your text-generation-webui folder in a terminal/command prompt and run the correct cmd version for your OS e.g. (`cmd_windows.bat`, `./cmd_linux.sh`, `cmd_macos.sh` or `cmd_wsl.bat`) and then you can type `python extensions\alltalk_tts\script.py` and see if AllTalk starts up correctly. If it does then something else is interfering. 

9) Something else is already loaded into your VRAM or there is a crashed python process. Either check your task manager for erroneous Python processes or restart your machine and try again.

10) You are running DeepSpeed on a Linux machine and although you are starting with `./start_linux.sh` AllTalk is failing there on starting. This is because text-generation-webui will overwrite some environment variables when it loads its python environment. To see if this is the problem, from a terminal go into your text-generation-webui folder and `./cmd_linux.sh` then set your environment variable again e.g. `export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda` (this may vary depending on your OS, but this is the standard one for Linux, and assuming you have installed the CUDA toolkit), then `python server.py` and see if it starts up. If you want to edit the environment permanently you can do so, I have not managed to write full instructions yet, but here is the conda guide [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#set-env-vars).

11) You have built yourself a custom Python environment and something is funky with it. This is very hard to diagnose as its not a standard environment. You may want to updating text-generation-webui and re installing its requirements file (whichever one you use that comes down with text-generation-webui).

#### 🟨 I activated DeepSpeed in the settings page, but I didnt install DeepSpeed yet and now I have issues starting up
<details>
	<summary>Click to expand</summary><br>
	
You can either follow the [Problems Updating](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts#-problems-updating) and fresh install your config. Or you can edit the `confignew.json` file within the `alltalk_tts` folder. You would look for '"deepspeed_activate": true,' and change the word true to false `"deepspeed_activate": false,' ,then save the file and try starting again.<br><br>

If you want to use DeepSpeed, you need an Nvidia Graphics card and to install DeepSpeed on your system. Instructions are [here](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts#-deepspeed-installation-options)

## ⚫ Finetuning a model
If you have a voice that the model doesnt quite reproduce correctly, or indeed you just want to improve the reproduced voice, then finetuning is a way to train your "XTTSv2 local" model **(stored in `/alltalk_tts/models/xxxxx/`)** on a specific voice. For this you will need:

- An Nvidia graphics card
- To install a few portions of the Nvidia CUDA 11.8 Toolkit (this will not impact text-generation-webui's cuda setup.
- 18GB of disk space free (most of this is used temporarily)
- At least 2 minutes of good quality speech from your chosen speaker in mp3, wav or flacc format, in one or more files (have tested as far as 20 minutes worth of audio).

#### ⚫ How will this work/How complicated is it?
Everything has been done to make this as simple as possible. At its simplest, you can literally just download a large chunk of audio from an interview, and tell the finetuning to strip through it, find spoken parts and build your dataset. You can literally click 4 buttons, then copy a few files and you are done. At it's more complicated end you will clean up the audio a little beforehand, but its still only 4x buttons and copying a few files.

#### ⚫ The audio you will use
I would suggest that if its in an interview format, you cut out the interviewer speaking in audacity or your chosen audio editing package. You dont have to worry about being perfect with your cuts, the finetuning Step 1 will go and find spoken audio and cut it out for you. Is there is music over the spoken parts, for best quality you would cut out those parts, though its not 100% necessary. As always, try to avoid bad quality audio with noises in it (humming sounds, hiss etc). You can try something like [Audioenhancer](https://audioenhancer.ai/) to try clean up noisier audio. There is no need to down-sample any of the audio, all of that is handled for you. Just give the finetuning some good quality audio to work with. 

#### ⚫ Important requirements CUDA 11.8
As mentioned you must have a small portion of the Nvidia CUDA Toolkit **11.8** installed. Not higher or lower versions. Specifically **11.8**. You do not have to uninstall any other versions, change any graphics drivers, reinstall torch or anything like that. To keep the download+install as small as possible, you will need to:
- Download the **xxx (network)** install of the Nvidia Cuda Toolkit 11.8 from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive)
- When you run the installation, select **Custom Advanced** as your installation type. Uncheck `CUDA`, `Other Components` and `Driver Components` at the top then expand `CUDA` > `Development` > `Compiler` > and select `nvcc` then expand `Libraries` and select `CUBLAS`
- Back at the top of `CUDA` expand `Runtime` > `Libraries` and select `CUBLAS`. You can now next through the install.
- When that has installed, open a terminal/command prompt and type `nvcc --version`. If it reports back `Cuda compilation tools, release 11.8.` you are good to go. **Specifically, 11.8**. If not continue to the next step.
- For both Windows an Linux, you will need to ensure that `nvcc` and the 11.8 cuda library files are in your environments search path. You can undo the changes below after finetuning if you prefer.<br><br>
  **Windows** - Edit the Windows PATH environment variable and add `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8\bin`<br><br>
  **Linux** - The path may be different depending on what flavour of Linux you are running, so you may need to seek out specific instructions on the internet. Generic paths **may** be:<br>
  `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.8/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:+:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}}` and<br>
  `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-11.8/bin`<br>
  Add these to your '~/.bashrc' if you want this to be permanent and not something you have to set each time you open a new terminal.<br><br>
- When you have made the changes, open a new terminal/command prompt and `nvcc --version`. It should report back `Cuda compilation tools, release 11.8.` at which point, you are good to go.
- If it doesnt report that, check you have correctly set the search environment paths, dont have overlapping other versions of cuda paths etc.

#### ⚫ Starting Finetuning
1) Close all other applications that are using your GPU/VRAM and copy your audio samples into:<br><br>
   `/alltalk_tts/finetune/put-voice-samples-in-here/`
3) In a command prompt/terminal window you need to move into your Text generation webUI folder:<br><br>
`cd text-generation-webui`

4) Start the Text generation webUI Python environment for your OS:<br><br>
`cmd_windows.bat`, `./cmd_linux.sh`, `cmd_macos.sh` or `cmd_wsl.bat`

5) You can double check your search path environment still works correctly with `nvcc --version`. It should report back 11.8:<br><br>
   `Cuda compilation tools, release 11.8.`

7) Move into your extensions folder:<br><br>
`cd extensions`

8) Move into the **alltalk_tts** folder:<br><br>
`cd alltalk_tts`

9) Install the finetune requirements file: `pip install -r requirements_finetune.txt`

10) Type `python finetune.py` and it should start up.
11) Follow the on-screen instructions when the web interface starts up.
12) When you have finished finetuning, the final tab will tell you what to do with your files and how to move your newly trained model to the correct location on disk.

## 🔵🟢🟡 DeepSpeed Installation Options
#### 🔵 Linux Installation
<details>
	<summary>Click to expand: Linux DeepSpeed installation</summary>

➡️DeepSpeed requires an Nvidia Graphics card!⬅️

1) Preferably use your built in package manager to install CUDA tools. Alternatively download and install the Nvidia Cuda Toolkit for Linux [Nvidia Cuda Toolkit 11.8 or 12.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)<br><br>
2) Open a terminal console.<br><br>
3) Install libaio-dev (however your Linux version installs things) e.g. `sudo apt install libaio-dev`<br><br>
4) Move into your Text generation webUI folder e.g. `cd text-generation-webui`<br><br>
5) Start the Text generation webUI Python environment `./cmd_linux.sh`<br><br>
6) Text generation webUI **overwrites** the **CUDA_HOME** environment variable each time you `./cmd_linux.sh` or `./start_linux.sh`, so you will need to either permanently change within the python environment OR set CUDA_HOME it each time you `./cmd_linux.sh`. Details to change it each time are on the next step. Below is a link to Conda's manual and changing environment variables permanently though its possible changing it permanently could affect other extensions, you would have to test.<br> <br>
[Conda manual - Environment variables](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#set-env-vars)<br><br>
7) You can temporarily set the **CUDA_HOME** environment with (Standard paths on Ubuntu, but could vary on other Linux flavours):<br><br>
`export CUDA_HOME=/etc/alternatives/cuda`<br><br>
**every** time you run `./cmd_linux.sh`.<br> <br>
If you try to start DeepSpeed with the CUDA_HOME path set incorrectly, expect an error similar to `[Errno 2] No such file or directory: /home/yourname/text-generation-webui/installer_files/env/bin/nvcc`<br> <br>
9) Now install deepspeed with pip install deepspeed<br><br>
10) You can now start Text generation webUI `python server.py` ensuring to activate your extensions.<br><br>
Just to reiterate, starting Text-generation-webUI with `./start_linux.sh` will overwrite the CUDA_HOME variable unless you have permanently changed it, hence always starting it with `./cmd_linux.sh` **then** setting the environment variable manually (step 7) and **then** `python server.py`, which is how you would need to run it each time, unless you permanently set the environment variable for CUDA_HOME within Text-generation-webUI's standard Python environment.
<br><br>
**Removal** - If it became necessary to uninstall DeepSpeed, you can do so with `./cmd_linux.sh` and then `pip uninstall deepspeed`<br><br>
</details>
	
#### 🟢🟡 Windows Installation
DeepSpeed v11.2 will work on the current default text-generation-webui Python 3.11 environment! You have 2x options for how to setup DeepSpeed on Windows. A quick way (🟢Option 1) and a long way (🟡Option 2).

Thanks to [@S95Sedan](https://github.com/S95Sedan) - They managed to get DeepSpeed 11.2 working on Windows via making some edits to the original Microsoft DeepSpeed v11.2 installation. The original post is [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/issues/4734#issuecomment-1843984142).

#### 🟢 OPTION 1 - Quick and easy!
<details>
	<summary>Click to expand: Pre-Compiled Wheel Deepspeed v11.2 (Python 3.11 and 3.10)</summary>
➡️DeepSpeed requires an Nvidia Graphics card!⬅️<br>

1) Download the correct wheel version for your Python/Cuda from [here](https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts/releases/tag/deepspeed) and save the file it inside your **text-generation-webui** folder.

2) Open a command prompt window, move into your **text-generation-webui folder**, you can now start the Python environment for text-generation-webui:<br><br>
`cmd_windows.bat`

3) With the file that you saved in the **text-generation-webui folder** you now type the following, replacing YOUR-VERSION with the name of the file you have:<br><br>
`pip install "deepspeed-0.11.2+YOUR-VERSION-win_amd64.whl"`
   
5) This should install through cleanly and you should now have DeepSpeed v11.2 installed within the Python 3.11/3.10 environment of text-generation-webui.
   
6) When you start up text-generation-webui, and AllTalk starts, you should see **[AllTalk Startup] DeepSpeed Detected**
    
7) Within AllTalk, you will now have a checkbox for **Activate DeepSpeed** though remember you can only change **1x setting every 15 or so seconds**, so dont try to activate DeepSpeed **and** LowVRAM/Change your model simultantiously. Do one of those, wait 15-20 seconds until the change is confirmed in the terminal/command prompt, then you can change the other. When you are happy it works, you can set the default start-up settings in the settings page.
<br><br>
**Removal** - If it became necessary to uninstall DeepSpeed, you can do so with `cmd_windows.bat` and then `pip uninstall deepspeed`<br><br>
</details>

#### 🟡 OPTION 2 - A bit more complicated!
<details>
	<summary>Click to expand: Manual Build DeepSpeed v11.2 (Python 3.11 and 3.10)</summary>
➡️DeepSpeed requires an Nvidia Graphics card!⬅️<br><br>

This will take about 1 hour to complete and about 6GB of disk space.<br>

1. Download the 11.2 release of [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed/releases/tag/v0.11.2) extract it to a folder. 
2. Install Visual C++ build tools, such as [VS2019 C++ x64/x86](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/redistribution#vs2019-download) build tools.
3. Download and install the [Nvidia Cuda Toolkit 11.8 or 12.1](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive)
4. **OPTIONAL** If you do not have an python environment already created and you are **not** going to use Text-generation-webui's environment, you can install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html), then at a command prompt, create and activate your environment with:<br><br>
```conda create -n pythonenv python=3.11```<br>
```activate pythonenv```<br>

5. Launch the Command Prompt cmd with Administrator privilege as it requires admin to allow creating symlink folders.
6. If you are using the **Text-generation-webui** python environment, then in the `text-generation-webui` folder you will run `cmd_windows.bat` to start the python evnironment.<br><br>
Otherwise Install PyTorch, 2.1.0 with CUDA 11.8 or 12.1 into your Python 3.1x.x environment e.g:<br><br>
```activate pythonenv``` (activate your python environment)<br>
```conda install pytorch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia```<br>
or<br>
```conda install pytorch==2.1.0 torchvision==0.16.0 torchaudio==2.1.0 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia```<br>

9. Set your CUDA Windows environment variables in the command prompt to ensure that CUDA_HOME and CUDA_PATH are set to your Nvidia Cuda Toolkit path. (The folder above the bin folder that nvcc.exe is installed in). Examples are:<br><br>
```set CUDA_HOME=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.1```<br>
```set CUDA_PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.1```<br>
or<br>
```set CUDA_HOME=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8```<br>
```set CUDA_PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.8```<br>

10. Navigate to wherever you extracted the deepspeed folder in the Command Prompt:<br><br>
```cd c:\DeepSpeed-0.11.2``` (wherever you extracted it to)

11. Modify the following files:<br>
**(These modified files are included in the git-pull of AllTalk, in the DeepSpeed Windows folder and so can just be copied over the top of the exsting folders/files, but if you want to modify them yourself, please follow the below)**<br>

deepspeed-0.11.2/build_win.bat - at the top of the file, add:<br><br>
 ```set DS_BUILD_EVOFORMER_ATTN=0```

deepspeed-0.11.2/csrc/quantization/pt_binding.cpp - lines 244-250 - change to:
```
    std::vector<int64_t> sz_vector(input_vals.sizes().begin(), input_vals.sizes().end());
    sz_vector[sz_vector.size() - 1] = sz_vector.back() / devices_per_node;  // num of GPU per nodes
    at::IntArrayRef sz(sz_vector);
    auto output = torch::empty(sz, output_options);

    const int elems_per_in_tensor = at::numel(input_vals) / devices_per_node;
    const int elems_per_in_group = elems_per_in_tensor / (in_groups / devices_per_node);
    const int elems_per_out_group = elems_per_in_tensor / out_groups;
```

deepspeed-0.11.2/csrc/transformer/inference/csrc/pt_binding.cpp
lines 541-542 - change to:
```
									 {static_cast<unsigned>(hidden_dim * InferenceContext::Instance().GetMaxTokenLength()),
									  static_cast<unsigned>(k * InferenceContext::Instance().GetMaxTokenLength()),
```

lines 550-551 - change to:
```
						 {static_cast<unsigned>(hidden_dim * InferenceContext::Instance().GetMaxTokenLength()),
						  static_cast<unsigned>(k * InferenceContext::Instance().GetMaxTokenLength()),
```
line 1581 - change to:
```
		at::from_blob(intermediate_ptr, {input.size(0), input.size(1), static_cast<int64_t>(mlp_1_out_neurons)}, options);
```

deepspeed-0.11.2/deepspeed/env_report.py
line 10 - add:
```
import psutil
```
line 83 - 100 - change to:
```
def get_shm_size():
    try:
        temp_dir = os.getenv('TEMP') or os.getenv('TMP') or os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), 'tmp')
        shm_stats = psutil.disk_usage(temp_dir)
        shm_size = shm_stats.total
        shm_hbytes = human_readable_size(shm_size)
        warn = []
        if shm_size < 512 * 1024**2:
            warn.append(
                f" {YELLOW} [WARNING] Shared memory size might be too small, consider increasing it. {END}"
            )
            # Add additional warnings specific to your use case if needed.
        return shm_hbytes, warn
    except Exception as e:
        return "UNKNOWN", [f"Error getting shared memory size: {e}"]
```

10. While still in your command line with python environment enabled run:<br>
```build_win.bat``` and wait 10-20 minutes.

11. Now `cd dist` to go into your dist folder and you can now `pip install deepspeed-YOURFILENAME.whl` (or whatever your WHL file is called).
<br><br>
**Removal** - If it became necessary to uninstall DeepSpeed, you can do so with `cmd_windows.bat` and then `pip uninstall deepspeed`<br><br>

## 🟠 API Suite and JSON-CURL
### 🟠Overview
The Text-to-Speech (TTS) Generation API allows you to generate speech from text input using various configuration options. This API supports both character and narrator voices, providing flexibility for creating dynamic and engaging audio content.

- URL: `http://127.0.0.1:7851/api/tts-generate`<br>
- Method: `POST`<br>
- Content-Type: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`<br>

### 🟠 Example command lines
Standard TTS speech Example (standard text) generating a time-stamped file<br>

`curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:7851/api/tts-generate" -d "text_input=All of this is text spoken by the character. This is text not inside quotes, though that doesnt matter in the slightest" -d "text_filtering=standard" -d "character_voice_gen=female_01.wav" -d "narrator_enabled=false" -d "narrator_voice_gen=male_01.wav" -d "text_not_inside=character" -d "language=en" -d "output_file_name=myoutputfile" -d "output_file_timestamp=true" -d "autoplay=true" -d "autoplay_volume=0.8"`<br>

Narrator Example (standard text) generating a time-stamped file

`curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:7851/api/tts-generate" -d "text_input=*This is text spoken by the narrator* \"This is text spoken by the character\". This is text not inside quotes." -d "text_filtering=standard" -d "character_voice_gen=female_01.wav" -d "narrator_enabled=true" -d "narrator_voice_gen=male_01.wav" -d "text_not_inside=character" -d "language=en" -d "output_file_name=myoutputfile" -d "output_file_timestamp=true" -d "autoplay=true" -d "autoplay_volume=0.8"`<br>

Note that if your text that needs to be generated contains double quotes you will need to escape them with `\"` (Please see the narrator example).

### 🟠 Request Parameters
🟠 **text_input**: The text you want the TTS engine to produce. Use escaped double quotes for character speech and asterisks for narrator speech if using the narrator function. Example:

`-d "text_input=*This is text spoken by the narrator* \"This is text spoken by the character\". This is text not inside quotes."`

🟠 **text_filtering**: Filter for text. Options:

- **none** No filtering. Whatever is sent will go over to the TTS engine as raw text, which may result in some odd sounds with some special characters.<br>
- **standard** Human-readable text and a basic level of filtering, just to clean up some special characters.<br>
- **html** HTML content. Where you are using HTML entity's like &quot;<br>

`-d "text_filtering=none"`<br>
`-d "text_filtering=standard"`<br>
`-d "text_filtering=html"`<br>

Example:

- **Standard Example**: `*This is text spoken by the narrator* "This is text spoken by the character" This is text not inside quotes.`<br>
- **HTML Example**: `&ast;This is text spoken by the narrator&ast; &quot;This is text spoken by the character&quot; This is text not inside quotes.`<br>
- **None**: `Will just pass whatever characters/text you send at it.`<br>

🟠 **character_voice_gen**: The WAV file name for the character's voice.<br>

`-d "character_voice_gen=female_01.wav"`

🟠 **narrator_enabled**: Enable or disable the narrator function. If true, minimum text filtering is set to standard. Anything between double quotes is considered the character's speech, and anything between asterisks is considered the narrator's speech.

`-d "narrator_enabled=true"`<br>
`-d "narrator_enabled=false"` 

🟠 **narrator_voice_gen**: The WAV file name for the narrator's voice.

`-d "narrator_voice_gen=male_01.wav"`

🟠 **text_not_inside**: Specify the handling of lines not inside double quotes or asterisks, for the narrator feature. Options:

- **character**: Treat as character speech.<br>
- **narrator**: Treat as narrator speech.<br>

`-d "text_not_inside=character"`<br>
`-d "text_not_inside=narrator"`

🟠 **language**: Choose the language for TTS. Options:

`ar Arabic`<br>
`zh-cn Chinese (Simplified)`<br>
`cs Czech`<br>
`nl Dutch`<br>
`en English`<br>
`fr French`<br>
`de German`<br>
`hu Hungarian`<br>
`it Italian`<br>
`ja Japanese`<br>
`ko Korean`<br>
`pl Polish`<br>
`pt Portuguese`<br>
`ru Russian`<br>
`es Spanish`<br>
`tr Turkish`<br>

`-d "language=en"`<br>

🟠 **output_file_name**: The name of the output file (excluding the .wav extension).

`-d "output_file_name=myoutputfile"`<br>

🟠 **output_file_timestamp**: Add a timestamp to the output file name. If true, each file will have a unique timestamp; otherwise, the same file name will be overwritten each time you generate TTS.

`-d "output_file_timestamp=true"`<br>
`-d "output_file_timestamp=false"`

🟠 **autoplay**: Feature not yet available. Enable or disable autoplay. Still needs to be specified in the JSON request.

`-d "autoplay=true"`<br>
`-d "autoplay=false"`

🟠 **autoplay_volume**: Feature not yet available. Set the autoplay volume. Should be between 0.1 and 1.0. Still needs to be specified in the JSON request.

`-d "autoplay_volume=0.8"`

### 🟠 TTS Generation Response
The API returns a JSON object with the following properties:

- **status** Indicates whether the generation was successful (generate-success) or failed (generate-failure).<br>
- **output_file_path** The on-disk location of the generated WAV file.<br>
- **output_file_url** The HTTP location for accessing the generated WAV file.<br>

Example JSON TTS Generation Response:

Replace True with False to disable Low VRAM mode.

JSON return `{"status": "lowvram-success"}`

### 🔴 Future to-do list
- Voice output within the command prompt/terminal (TBD).
- Correct a few spelling mistakes in the documentation.
- Possibly add some additional TTS engines (TBD).
- Have a break!
